The Granny Penalty: Navigating the Challenges of Informal Childcare (with Gitanjali Sen), Submitted
Abstract: This study examines the impact of grandchild care on the labor market outcomes of grandparents amid the rapid aging and feminization of the global population. Employing an instrumental variable approach, we find a substantial negative effect on the employment rate of grandmothers, particularly for those cohabiting with their children, while no significant effect is observed for grandfathers. These findings suggest that grandchild caregiving contributes to the gender gap in labor force participation among the elderly, with a more pronounced effect in urban areas. We also find that the reduction in labor supply occurs primarily among younger grandmothers, indicating an early withdrawal from the workforce.  
Women and the Web: Connectivity and crime against women (with Gitanjali Sen)

Young Lives, Deep Mines: The Impact of Mineral Proximity on Child Health
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of proximity to mineral deposits and active mines on child health outcomes in India, leveraging a unique spatial discontinuity approach. By exploiting natural geographic variation in the distribution of mineral deposits across villages, we isolate the effects of exposure to mining activities on childrenâ€™s health.
